Google has quietly been using our personal information for its giant corporation fuel for various things buy we are going to focus on advertisement today, this post will demonstrate how .

# G Mail

<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/gmail.png">

Gmail is the most used email service in the world as present and most of us use Gmail to open other accounts on social media and other internet services that requires email authentication

# Android

<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/android.png">

70% of worlds smartphones is powered by android which cannot operate with ought a google account weather actively being used or not or not, so if you are using an android smartphone know that you are being monitored and used for advertisement with ought your permission and WI thought being aware in ways that you are soon to understand

# Chrome

<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/chrome.png">

65 % of all internet surfers weather web or mobile use google chrome, and are more likely to experience what i am about to explain

For example, you can see how many apps or websites or whatever you want to call it that you use google to sign in or authenticate with, my guess is there are more than 5, but for internode like me It was more than 50 which I did unconsciously and google uses my personal information for all those 50 accounts to advertise
 And this is how

# Google AddWords

<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/gadds.png">

There is a google service called google AddWords which is widely used by developers including me I can’t lie, to make money hand off with zero effort, but you make money depending on your traffic, for google add to work there is a few lines of code that you embed into your website and boom it works ,we are not going into deep to that but point is google adds is everywhere where 90% uses google adds to advertise that means you cannot surf for 30 min with ought seeing one

This is how you can recognize google adds, there are usually not big they are about 10% height and 15 % width of the page and vice versa and they have a minuscule little blue icon at the top right of them, the square ones will mostly be at the right of your feeds
<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/gadd1.png">

and the rectangle ones will mostly be at the top or at the bottomn and sometimes in the middle of an article
<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/gadd2.png">


however, when you use google adds, you have no powered to what so ever google is going to be advertised on your website or app, they did this so that adds can be variant and interchange based on the person visiting or using your app, where google uses their personal information to show the adds that they exactly what they want to see based on their interest

<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/gwatch.png">

this is pure violation of privacy that google Is using to sell and fuel its giant corporation agenda
this is how you can experiment this for yourself, if you use Google chrome, you are obviously logged in with your google account, make you way to google and choose one key word or a sentence that you are going to search for the whole day and mock my words you are going to see advertisement that relates 100% of what you have been searching for


<img class = "img-responsive" src="{{site.github.url}}/img/tube.png">

and this doesn’t stop on google adds only, this goes on with YouTube which was acquired by google a long time ago, and an average internet user can not go 12h with ought access to YouTube, and those pre videos that you are forced to watch and  can only skip after a few seconds which means you are unconsciously forced to watch the add for a few seconds and you won’t notice it or it won’t bother you  because it is based exactly on your interests,and they also come in other different formats
