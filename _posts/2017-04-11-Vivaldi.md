Some people like beuty over power when it comes to teck,but what if you could have both whith <a href="https://vivaldi.com"> <strong>VIVALDI browser</strong> </a>,with an adictive User Interface for UI intuitive people which is fully customisable 

vivaldi butifull UI merges with the sites colors that you are visiting bringng a great browsing experience

The beuty package comes with a set of powefull tools including developer tools
whis opens up as a new tab,which is a delight for developers instead of stacking up with the site you inspect

maybe ur a student and you find a realy catchy article ,just save it in straight from your bwowser in the note tool

Unfortunately vivaldi is not available on mobile devices yet,but there is a great alternative for vivaldi on mobile which is <a href="play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mark.via.gp"> <strong>Via</strong> </a> 

Via is just amazing and very simple

Mobile being the wiedly used divices to surf the web deserves a good experience and Via is just there for it i , i honestly dont understand how its not very popular yet with only 100k download on google play
