Hello Friend! I have found something that will not be good to play with. as we know the most popular realtime or chat messaging app is WhatsApp.

Because of being the most popular chat message app has led it to be most used and targeted platform to scam people as well as new channel or way to help bad guys share malware. Scams is an illegal plan or activity that involves tricking people, and most of the scam we use to see on WhatsApp are those messages that tell us to forward the messages to our friends. Malware also known as malicious software that refer to forms of intrusive  software like viruses,spyware,trojan and many others.

Even if some users are aware of these message, it look like bad guys are always ahead to some users, because they always find new ways to trick people.

as of now there is scam that is spreading around promising people that it’s offering a new way of customizing WhatsApp in different colors. 

What some people are not recognizing is that, the url that is being shared is not Whatsapp’s official website, people are being directed to a totally different website. So if the user visit that website by clicking the shared link, the website will show him/her various instructions to follow in order to change their WhatsApp colors. Users will need to share its link to their friends for verification.

Friends what you have to be aware of is that you are installing adware to your device, and I know most of you knows how bad adware are. I would advice  any user to analyze the message first before clicking any link.
