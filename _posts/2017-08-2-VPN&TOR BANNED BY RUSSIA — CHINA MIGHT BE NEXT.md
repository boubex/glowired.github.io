President Vladimir Putin has banned the use of VPN and anonymiser technologies such as Tor. This ban has been approved by the Russian lower house of parliament and will come into effect on November 1st.

Practically speaking, there is nothing wrong with what Putin has done. After all, VPN can be used to access websites that are restricted by the State. So, Putin has only done what is best for national interest. However, this move goes against the Open Web philosophy and further centralizes the Internet.

An argument could be made of course that it also decentralizes it in some sense as it blocks the use of sites that are known as big threats to the Open Web. Whether or not the Russian people will be happy with this is unclear. They already have a great Eco-system of websites and apps and so this ban is going to be, at worst, shrugged off by most Russians.

China too, is strengthening its grip on control of accessible Internet services. The latest development has come in the form of Apple’s restriction of VPN apps on the App Store. China’s ‘Great Firewall’ bans services such as Whatsapp, Facebook and Youtube. VPN has until now been the best way to access these restricted sites but this is bound to become more difficult for iPhone users. We’ll have to wait and see if  Google will follow Apple’s example.
