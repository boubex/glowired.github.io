There are two main things that make you unsafe. the first one is mixing your hacking life and your personal life, secondly is using the internet without anonymizing your traffic.

But remember these are not the only mistake that makes you unsafe in the wild. what will help you to not accidentally mix them will be to use different computers or use virtual machines if you are comfortable with them.

There are many anonymity open project and you can even customize your own. These are the most known 

<a class="anonymous" href="https://www.whonix.org">Whonix</a>,
<a class="anonymous" href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>, 
<a class="anonymous" href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/torvm/">Qubes TorVM</a>

All these project anonymize your traffic through tor, even if as many of us trust Tor. Some research has shown that it is not anonymous as we believe it. Because there have been successful attack against Tor. You might think of  increasing your anonymity by using Tor over public wifi or connect to a VPN before Tor, these are also less secure because they can still correlate your activity. Even if Tor isn’t perfect, it works very well and I recommend it to you. Many of us do some hacking stuff without any protection not even using Tor, but that is not good because you might get caught unexpectedly.

## Solutions
Don’t hack directly from Tor exit nodes, because they are slow. Tor protects your anonymity while you connect to the infrastructure you use to hack with, which consist of Domain names for address, and for DNS tunnels, VPS used to receive connect-back shells to launch attacks, Hacked Servers can be used as central point to hide the IP addresses of your VPS, and for when you want a fast connection without using your VPS to scan ports, xss, download a database with sqli and so on .. . 

To accomplish this you have to use anonymous payment method, like Bitcoin to pay the VPS and this should be used carefully, because even if you think of it as an anonymous payment method it’s no longer a remedy as you think. you need some deep understanding of it and their will be some modifications to it, to increase your anonymity.

Don’t get caught because of your mistake of using repeatedly the same tools, infrastructure, leaving footprints don’t make any one job easier to trace you back. try to mix your hacking by using new domain names, VPS, emails, and paying with new bitcoin addresses. Get many ways of doing things to not leave your footprint to not get caught by forensic. 

Friends none of this is 100%, nothing I recommend is guaranteed to protect your anonymity. Whether it is today, tomorrow and forever, in my believe is that every security measure will eventually be compromised. That the power of technology and that why I like it.


It is at your own risk to follow or do anything that I write.
