Overall when you are intuitive into starting programing ,you might run into confusion with so many technologies and frameworks out there that it will be difficult to choose but if you are looking for a 0$ cost effective including deployment and hosting and security short time full stack solutions and build complete apps that are cross platform and that will run on any Device then you are in the right place ,for starters Angular js is the right solution for you, over the past few years angular has proven a quick growth from being a client side language to being a complete frame work its self with a large community behind it , angular 2 and 4 now have CLI option tool built on the inspiration from ember js which generates for you a whole lot of resource s making building your app a whole lot faster

# Database

Why is angular very cost effective for every typical programmer and medium project on the web, a functional app with users needs a database, while there are many solutions out there ,I recommend firebase which was recently acquired  by google and has a large community out there and perfectly support angular

Firebase has a free package which include 5GB of storage and 1GB of real time database which Is great for putting your app out there, and then if you decide to scale you can choose their commercial option, in my opinion I have been building software for the past 2 years but I have not exceeded those resources, you would not be surprised if I told you that this whole website doesn’t exceed 20 megabytes

Firebase has a real time database which means that update happen automatically happen withought a git intervention and everything is saved as  Jason file which is amazing because you can pull information from your database from anywhere as if you were using a REST api ,I my opinion ,you create an api for you app with ought even realizing it



# Hosting

Now when you want to host your app, the best and secure solution would be git lab, which offers 10 GB of free space and free repositories ,which is insane in my opinion, and best of all they use Docker for build and completely build for angular js, which means your app will run smoothly as it runs locally, it lab is the perfect solution for getting your app from your local development to the world with augh spending a dime, isn’t that amazing

# Security

For security your app need to be encrypted to be safe from hackers out there , I would recommend lets encrypt which gives free HTTPS over your domain which you would normally pay at least 200$ a year from most domain providers , keep in mid it requires a bit of hacking to achieve this but any novice programer can do it

#Cross platform development

If you know how to build websites then you already know how to build apps , and the best solution would be ionic frame work if you want to know more about ionic check out there website ,what I’m going to say about ionic is that every app build with ionic is built with a huge chunk of its code and functionalities are built with angular js, and ionic is fully integrates with fire base as its database , you see what’s happening here…, you can use one real time database for both your web app and mobile app which equals into a  complete full stack app



# Conclusion

With this guide you can fully build a fully functional secure cross plat form app with one code base , one real time database with ought spending a dime

happy hacking .... :)
