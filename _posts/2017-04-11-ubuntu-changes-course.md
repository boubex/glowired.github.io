Ubuntu's leader Mark Shuttleworth's news of discontinuing the Unity Desktop environment has been quite a shock. In addition to this, Ubuntu will also stop working on the Mir Convergence system.

These decisions come after what has been an unprofitable investment for the company: working on Mir and spending time and resources designing the unique Unity Desktop.

## The Future

Ubuntu will switch to the Gnome Shell for its desktop environment for all its future distribution releases. This however isn't such a bad thing, many linux distributions already and have for a long time used the Gnome shell and this is evidence enough of its strength and efficiency.

The good news is that snaps will continue to be developed and invested in.
